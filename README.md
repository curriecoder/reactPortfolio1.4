# React Portfolio

Deployed: https://curriecoder.github.io/react-portfolio-rev1/

Repo: https://github.com/curriecoder/react-portfolio-rev1

## Description

This portfolio was creacted using React to display works. I wanted to get used to using React for MVC due to it's popularity in the market. The main motivation for creating this project is to showcase projects I have been a part of to potential collaborators/employers. I learned a metric ton about React and how to build a single page application that feels like a multi-page application using conditional rendering. This portfolio allows me to gain additional visibility in the job market.
