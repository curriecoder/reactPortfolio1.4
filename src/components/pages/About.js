      Andrew J. Currie - Software engineer and U.S. Army veteran with experience in coding and advanced troubleshooting. Certificate from University of Pennsylvania in full stack web technologies, including React.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Node.js. Known as a natural leader with a great attention to detail, I have been an asset to teams providing direction and quality assurance. Understanding the UX as well as how the database is structured has allowed me to work from the front-end to the back-end without issue. I worked on a team of four to develop a multi-page MERN app that allows users to register as a member to gain access to a chess training app with a built- in AI opponent, a live feed of high level chess games, as well as a database that stores chess puzzles to be practiced. In this project I worked primarily on the up front wire framing, the building of the database, taking lead on troubleshooting the front end/deployment issues. My technical aptitude in cutting-edge web technologies, in combination with acute attention to detail while problem solving, make me a strong addition to any team.
